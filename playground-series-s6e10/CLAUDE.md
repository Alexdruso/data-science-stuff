# Predicting Airline Satisfaction (playground-series-s6e10)

**Task**: binary classification — predict `satisfaction` (passenger satisfied vs neutral/dissatisfied)
**Metric**: ROC AUC on the predicted probability. Submission: `id,satisfaction` (probability).
**Deadline**: 2026-10-31 23:59 UTC — **queried from the source** (`kaggle competitions list -s
playground-series-s6e10` and the competition's Timeline page) on 2026-10-05. Start date
2026-10-01. Never carry a deadline that no document sourced: an unsourced "~Aug 2" ran through
22 days of s6e7 planning and the real date was Jul 31.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Row-order invariant — always load labels and IDs through build_features()

`features.py::build_features()` sorts every dataframe by `["id"]`. All
`results/oof_<model>.npy` and `results/test_<model>.npy` arrays are stored in this sorted order.

`build_features()` also **renames the raw headers to snake_case** and **coerces the target to
Int8 0/1**, so reading `TARGET` from a raw CSV is wrong twice over (order *and* encoding).

```python
# CORRECT
y = build_features(pl.read_csv(DATA_DIR / "train.csv"))[TARGET].to_numpy()
test_ids = build_features(pl.read_csv(DATA_DIR / "test.csv"))["id"].to_numpy()

# WRONG — raw CSV order ≠ npy order, and the raw target may not be 0/1
y = pl.read_csv(DATA_DIR / "train.csv")[TARGET].to_numpy()
```

## ⚠️ No data leakage — fold-aware rules

1. **Target encoding is fold-aware, NEVER global.** Fit any target-derived feature on the
   fold's training split only (`data_science_stuff.kaggle.encoding`).
2. **Group stats over feature columns** (no per-row targets) may use the full raw train CSV as
   global priors — if used, document that choice here explicitly.
3. **Original-data augmentation** (`data/original/data.csv`): rows may be appended to each
   fold's *training* split only — never to the validation split, or OOF stops measuring the
   synthetic distribution the LB is scored on.

## Dataset

Synthetic, generated from the [Airline satisfaction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arseniyshutko/binary-aviation-satisfaction-129k)
("feature distributions close to, but not exactly the same as, the original").

| Split | Rows | Columns | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| train | ? (67 MB CSV) | ? | **not yet downloaded** |
| test  | ? (27 MB CSV; first id 699635 ⇒ train ≈ 700k rows) | ? | **not yet downloaded** |
| original | 129,880 | 22 (no id) | `data/original/data.csv` |

**⚠️ Competition data download returns 403 until the rules are accepted on the Kaggle site.**
Then: `kaggle competitions download -c playground-series-s6e10 -p data/ && cd data && unzip -q
playground-series-s6e10.zip && rm playground-series-s6e10.zip`. The schema below is from the
original dataset; **verify it against the synthetic headers and target encoding on first
download** and update this section.

### Raw features (original schema; snake_case after `build_features`)

- Categorical: `gender` (M/F), `customer_type` (Loyal / disloyal), `type_of_travel`
  (Business / Personal), `class` (Business / Eco / Eco Plus)
- Numeric: `age`, `flight_distance`, `departure_delay_in_minutes`, `arrival_delay_in_minutes`
  (393 NaN in the original)
- 13 service ratings, 0-5: `inflight_wifi_service`, `departure_arrival_time_convenient`,
  `ease_of_online_booking`, `gate_location`, `food_and_drink`, `online_boarding`,
  `seat_comfort`, `inflight_entertainment`, `on_board_service`, `leg_room_service`,
  `baggage_handling`, `checkin_service`, `cleanliness`

Original target: bool, 43.4% positive (56,428 / 129,880).

## Key EDA findings

- **Original:** a 0 rating means "not applicable", not "worst" — mean 0.15 zero-ratings per row.
  Kept raw (trees split on it) and counted as `n_zero_ratings`.
- **Original is near-separable:** the v1 baseline scores **OOF AUC 0.99491** on a 100k/30k split
  of the *original* data (pipeline smoke test, 2026-10-05). Expect the synthetic set to be noisier
  and the plateau to arrive early — the game will be in the 4th decimal.
- TODO on first download: adversarial validation (`kaggle.shift.adversarial_validation`),
  missingness *mechanism* per column (`kaggle.shift.mask_mechanism_report` — s6e7 lesson 8),
  category overlap, synthetic vs original marginals.

## Current best

None yet — run `python src/baseline.py` once the data is downloaded.

| Model | OOF AUC | Script |
|---|---|---|
| LGBM v1 | — | `src/baseline.py` |

---

## Feature engineering

`src/features.py::build_features()` (v1): raw columns + `rating_mean/min/max`,
`n_zero_ratings`, `n_high_ratings` (≥4), `delay_recovered` (arr − dep), `delay_max`,
`delay_per_mile`.

## Modelling notes

- **Shared utilities live in `data_science_stuff.kaggle`** — import, never copy.
- **CV**: `run_cv` (5-fold stratified, random_state=42). Scores logged to `results/cv_scores.csv`.
- **OOF/test arrays store the positive-class probability** (1-D). AUC is rank-based: no
  threshold/decision layer.
- **GPU**: LightGBM via `get_lgbm_device()` (CUDA probe, CPU fallback).
- **GPU memory rule (all PyTorch scripts)**: `del` model + optimizer + tensors before returning
  from each fold; `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after each fold/trial.
- **Categoricals**: pandas `category` with a shared train∪test level set for LGBM/XGB;
  `cat_features` for CatBoost; OHE for nets.

## Final submission selection

Use the `select-finals` skill: rank by **OOF CV, not public LB**; two diverse finals.

---

## Next steps (remove each item when implemented)

1. **Accept the rules on Kaggle**, download, verify schema/target encoding, run `baseline.py`.
2. EDA: adversarial validation, mask mechanism, synthetic-vs-original drift.
3. Original-data augmentation (train-split only, with an `is_original` flag) — the classic
   Playground lever; pre-register the bar before running.
4. XGBoost / CatBoost legs (`add-model`), then tune the strongest leg — s6e8 showed one tuned
   leg can beat a whole untuned blend.
5. Treat ratings as categoricals (CatBoost native / TE on rating crosses) — the 0 = N/A
   semantics make them non-ordinal at one end.
